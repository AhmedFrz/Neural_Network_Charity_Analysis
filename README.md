# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview and purpose

A non profit foundation Alphabet Soup
Dedicated to improving people well being 
Analyze the impact of each investment
She is asked to do the risk assessment about which company to donate
It is asked to create a mathematical data driven solution which can do this accurately
Hence, a deep learning neural network. This will evaluate all types of input data and produce a clear decision making 
We will design and train these models using Python Tensorflow library
